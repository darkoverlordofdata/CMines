# CMines

port of GNUstep demo GMines, using Cappuccino 


This is a reboot of the project. It will have to be rewritten, due to gaps in the cappuccino api(see notes.md)

I'm following the techniques in the LightsOut demo, which uses CALayer and *.png images - a more modern approach than using post script, so in the long run, this is ok.
